==================
Openerp-7 Automated Deployment to Vagrant VMs using Capistrano and GIT

Capistrano - A ruby based deployment tool, generally used for rails application deployment

Note:- We need to create custom capistrano task and stop some of its default tasks under deploy.

Right now we have a working capistrano recipe dependent on two bash scripts to do the task

Objective: To make completely ruby based recipes
